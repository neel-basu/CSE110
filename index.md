## Styling Text

There are a couple of ways to style text in Markdown.
- **Bold**
- *Italic*
- ~~Strikethrough~~
- **Bold and _nested italic_**
- ***All bold and italic***
- <sub>Subscript</sub>
- <sup>Superscript</sup>

## Quoting Text

This is how quoted text looks

> This is a quote

## Quoting Code

This is how quoted code looks `git push`. You can also do blocks of code

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```
